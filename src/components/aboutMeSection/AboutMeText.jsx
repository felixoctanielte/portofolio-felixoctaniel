      <p>
        Hello, my name is Felix. I am a 2nd-year Informatics student at
        Multimedia Nusantara University with a strong interest in data analysis
        and artificial intelligence. With a background in programming and
        algorithmic thinking, I focus on developing solutions that are not only
        functional but also intelligent and adaptable to real-world needs. For
        me, AI is not just a technology, but a transformative tool that reshapes
        how we understand, process, and utilize information efficiently in this
        ever-evolving digital era.
